# Hello-world
it's my first Github repository for my personal projects starting point.

Since I left Pfizer on Sep. 30, 2019 after 9 years + 5 days working for the company, I have prepared my Alibaba Cloud Professional exam and ready to take it on Oct. 18th. Then I will start my next one on ACP big data. As a popular tool for future some job, I started trying the Github and started my personal project to work out a tool to help my wife and me to replicated pictures and videos from our mobile phones to ALibaba OSS. Hope I can grasp all these tools and make them meaningful in my skillset plate.
Cheers,
Zhao, Bing
